TODO this hint file should contain the **first hint** you might give your candidate when he seeks for help.
This hint should help him get closer to the solution without giving up all of it.

The following lines provide an actual sample of briefing that we find satisfying.

To delete an entry, you might use the **DELETE** keyword.

Hope this helps!
