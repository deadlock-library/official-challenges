TODO this hint file should contain the **first hint** you might give your candidate when he seeks for help.
This hint should help him get closer to the solution without giving up all of it.

The following lines provide an actual sample of briefing that we find satisfying.

Well, in R, you can nicely split a String into a nice array of characters following each other.
It might be easier for you to manipulate the array of characters rather than the String to get your result.

We suggest you use the function `strsplit()` to convert your String, and wrap the result around a new String using the `paste()` function.
