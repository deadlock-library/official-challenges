TODO this briefing file should contain a **FUN** description written using the **Markdown** syntax.  
Remember that every Deadlock challenge should be both **entertaining** and **useful**. It helps to provide a fun context around what you are trying to achieve as contexts give **purpose**.

The briefing should be as exhaustive as possible to enable your candidates to succeed. It should not however give out too many details in **how** to succeed. The **hints** (two other mandatory files in this folder) will be helpful to guide your candidate towards success if the briefing was not enough.

The following lines provide an actual sample of briefing that we find satisfying.

### The Reverse Machine
Your best friend loves riddles, and thought it was funny to send you a letter with ALL the sentences spelled backwards.
After thinking that now would be a good time for a change of best friend, you decide that you might as well get to it.

Instead of decrypting the message letter by letter, you decide to write a simple code which will do the work for you.

### What it is supposed to do
Let's say that the sentence your friend wrote was : `?uoy era woH !olleH`

The output of your code should return `Hello! How are you?`

Simple right?
