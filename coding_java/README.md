# What the sample contains
This sample contains a full implementation of a small Java challenge, which uses a seed file (seeds.txt).

The sample challenge is about **spelling a text backwards**.

All your java source files should be copied to the **app/** directory, and the **main** entrypoint should be in a class named **App.java**

# Check-list
1. Modify the sample code in the **app/** directory to implement your own challenge
2. Create the template file which will be sent to your candidates as a codebase (**Template.java** in our case)
3. Change the **challenge.yaml** descriptor to match your challenge settings: skills, template, target
4. Update the docs **briefing**, **hint1**, and **hint2**
5. Update the 4 mandatory test templates in the **test** folder
